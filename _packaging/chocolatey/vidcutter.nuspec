    <summary>the simplest + fastest video cut &amp; merge tool</summary>
    <description>
    The simplest &amp; sexiest tool for cutting and joining your videos without needing to re-encode.
    VidCutter focuses on just getting the job done using the best options determined from your source media.
    Did we mention it was super fast too? :-)

    Installation directory = C:\Program Files\VidCutter
    </description>
    <releaseNotes>
 * dark and light themes; chosen in the new settings sub-menu found in the
    right-click menu or via menu toolbar icon

 * new settings sub-menu (right-click or menu toolbar icon). some blurb
   on the settings (since i am too lazy to produce a help file right now :-)

    - Themes = select from the new dark and light themes (requires app restart)

    - Keep individual clips = each clip made from the clip index, which are then
       merged to produce the final product, are not deleted at end of proceess.
       They can be found in the same folder as the final produced video file 
       with file name sequence 001....00n appended.

    - Use native dialogs = on by default; can switch off to not use your 
      desktop manager's native file open/save dialogs and instead use a generic
      cross-platform version supplied by Qt framework.

    - Always on top = sets application window as the top-most window, avoiding
      others apps from displaying over the top of it.

    - Toolbar labels = self-explanatory; allows you to set the main toolbar
      labels to display beside icons (default), under icons or hidden from view.

    - Hardware decoding = on by default to make the most of your GPU hardware.
      Switch this off if you are experiencing problems with the video playback.
      This option doesn't affect video cutting itself and is primarily for playback.

    - Keep aspect ratio = as the title suggests, switching this off caues video
      fill the available frame space rather than maintain its intended ratio for
      viewport width and height. This option doesn't affect video cutting itself
      and is primarily for playback.

    - Zoom = zoom in video from half its original size and up to double. This
      option doesn't affect video cutting itself and is primarily for playback.

    - a few minor changes to keyboard shortcuts; check the keyboad shortcuts
      cheatsheet via right-click or toolbar menu options.

 * new app icon

 * improved timeline look + new slider image + remove awkward mouse cursor
    previously in use to standard pointing hand cursor which feels better IMHO.

 * new VidCutter project file format; this is the same as an EDL but includes
    the full path to the media file associated with it. These can be saved and
    opened after program launch to set you back to where you last were in a
    cutting project.

 * eeePC and better support for HiDPI

 * better handling of multistreamed video sources including VOB files; if the
    standard method of creation produces a 0 length file the app will now run
    it again using various other methods to achieve th desired result. all cases
    reported by users as bugs in this area are now working. in most cases you
    will continue to get back exactly what you put in (pardon the pun). some VOBs
    are problematic so until the UI is built to allow users finer control over the
    backend settings the app will continue to make its own best judgement on
    behalf of the user. so, in the worse case scenario you should now get back a
    valid video file instead of 0 length video, but it may only include a single audio
    track rather than all the tracks from the source. keep in mind that in these rare
    cases the app will choose the best quality audio/video track when it can only 
    work with just the one stream. The next version will allow you to select which
    streams from source media to include in your final generated video file.

 * improved handling of corrupted media files. the app should now work with far
    more source files than before.

 * time counter widget created allowing manual entry of timecode. just click on 
    the time segment to edit and video will seek to that exact point OR use the
    up/down arrow controls to the right of the running time code, highlight the
    segment you wish to increase or decrease (i.e. hours, mins, secs, msecs)

 * new dark theme; app is now better integrated for those who prefer to work
    with the darker side of the force; configurable via new menu option

 * video zoom level option added; configurable via new menu option

 * "Check for updates..." now checks for the latest release version of the app
   via the GitHub API and alerts user accordingly. It only offers to take user to
   release page while also explaining to stick with distriubution specific packages
   if running on Linux. Automatic updates are a goal of the future but would only
   be for Windows, macOS and AppImage linux versions.

 * The app will automatically check for updates; it will do this weekly and only
    disturb the user if an update has been released AND it has been at least one
    week since the last time updates were checked for.

 * new startup graphic.

 * new look dialogs including updater and about.

 * application settings now saved across all platforms; this includes window
   state and geometry as well as new settings in right-click context menu.
